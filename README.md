Structure, Assembly and Evolution of Natural Tritrophic Communities

Tritrophic communities of plants, insect herbivores and associated
parasitoid natural enemies together comprise more than 50% of all described species, and
include both beneficial ecosystem service providers (pollinators, biocontrol agents) and major
economic pests. Remarkably, however, we lack a general understanding of the processes by
which such multi-trophic communities assemble, and this constitutes a major challenge in
ecology. It is clear that both herbivore diversification and assemblage structure receive bottomup
influences via plant traits: plants with similar traits (and particularly chemical defences) are often
attacked by phylogenetically similar sets of herbivores. Enemies also exert top-down impacts
on herbivore population dynamics and evolution. However, the extent to which bottom-up and
top-down effects combine to define the structure of interactions across three trophic levels remains
poorly understood. This project addresses two key questions: (a) Do plant traits also
influence the diversification and assemblage structure of natural enemies? (b) Do natural enemies
exert their own ‘top-down’ effects on herbivore diversification and assemblage structure? The
answers to these questions matter because they predict the strength and direction of selection at
different trophic levels, and the topology and strength of interactions within trophic networks.
They are central to predicting the cascading impacts of species gain or loss2, both of which are
increasingly frequent in communities worldwide.
